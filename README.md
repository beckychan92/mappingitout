# Project - *MappingItOut*


**MappingItOut** is a map interface with a visual indicator on the
map that animates from one geo-coordinate point to another (based on the given geo-coordinate points).

The following functionality is completed:
- [X] Parse the JSON file
- [X] Create an application where map view encompasses most of the screen
space.
- [0.5] Within the app, you must add an in-map overlay that initially point to the first
geo-coordinate point provided from the JSON file.
- [0.5] With every passing 0.5 seconds, animate the overlay from the previous (or
initial) point to the next geo-coordinate point.
- [X] User should be able to pan and zoom the map interface, without affecting the
in-map overlay's position relative to the geo-spatial coordinate plane.
- [X]] User's touch events should not block the animation from being performed,
and vice-versa.
